Training my mind through meditation has enabled me to find calm more easily, slow down my pace, dissolve stress and boost my confidence on achieving my resolutions. It's been one of the biggest life improvements I've recently had. But not every meditation style resonates with me. It was when I read [Passage Meditation by Eknath Easwaran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passage_Meditation) that I found the right method for me. It may be the right method for you as well.

# The Passage

Meditation consists on training the mind to focus. In order to help, we use an anchor, something to help us hold the attention. On passage meditation, we use an inspirational passage as our anchor. It could be any text, as long as it's uplifting and helps us connect with the best version of ourselves. We become what we meditate on. Spiritual passages can serve this purpose magnificently. The meditation process  consists on slowly and silently repeating the memorized passage in our minds.

The passage I normally use is the Prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi:

> Lord, make me an instrument of your peace,\
> Where there is hatred, let me show love;\
> Where there is injury, let me show pardon;\
> Where there is doubt, let me show faith;\
> Where there is despair, let me show hope;\
> Where there is darkness, let me show light;\
> Where there is sadness, let me show joy.

> O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek\
> To be consoled as to console,\
> To be understood as to understand,\
> To be loved as to love;\
> For it is in giving that we receive;\
> It is in pardoning that we are pardoned;\
> It is in dying to self that we are born to eternal life.

Note that Lord here can mean different things for different individuals. For me, it represents both the universe as a whole and the true consciousness inside me.

# How?

Starting the day with meditation will be a gift to yourself. It will also enable it to become a habit, necessary to experience the its benefits. Before starting, I set an alarm with a smooth sound to let me know that 15 minutes have passed, marking the end of my meditation.

The mind repeats the passage silently, focusing on every word, one by one, very slowly. There's no rush. The slower, the harder it will be to stay focused, but also the benefit will be bigger. As the author says, "concentrate on every word and let the words slip one after another into your consciousness like pearls falling into a clear pond".

The posture should be comfortable, sitting erect. I prefer to sit on a chair as it's less demanding for the body than being cross-legged on the floor.

The mind doesn't like to be still, so it will try to find ways to wander away from the passage. It will bring thoughts, questions and worries to distract you. They way to deal with them is to remember the intention at this moment: to meditate. Since you can think those things later, just pass them along and go back to focusing on the passage words. Distractions also come as body sensations, like itches and discomforts. Doubling the focus on the words of the passage will make them fade away.

It helps a lot to have a special place for meditation in your house or room. Adding a candle or a blanket might help make it feel more spiritual and peaceful.
