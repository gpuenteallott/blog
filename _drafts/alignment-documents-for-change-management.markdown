In the day-to-day of the organization, you know what we don't want of?

That's right. No **surprise changes**, please. Not organizational. Not with responsibilities. Not with priorities. Not with processes.

Change is good though. Evolution is good. It can be exciting, an opportunity. But most people (including me) need to feel safe in order to produce great work.

Surprise changes lead to uncertainty. Uncertainty leads to anxiety. Anxiety leads to fear (and the dark side of the force).

How can managers roll out changes without triggering fear and anxiety? I've messed up many times with this. But this step-by-step recipe is working out rather well for me these days:

1. Duplicate the [change rollout document template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yq-gFbKIXfE7JQuDUlO0SSHS7dGqabq0aPTVOojDROU/edit?usp=sharing).

2. Fill it out.

3. Share it with the appropriate stakeholders.

4. Collaborate asynchronously to address feedback.

5. Schedule a brief alignment meeting if necessary to discuss open questions.

6. Roll out the change as described in the timeline.

This way, people have time to digest the impact of the change on their own time. To think through their concerns. To have all the information in front of them.

Executing changes using alignment documents is a fantastic way to collaborate. Charlie Irwin and I are producing 3-6 small changes across Splash Engineering per month to enable teams to produce better quality outcomes and reduce friction points. And the impacted stakeholders have plenty of time to offer feedback or ask clarification questions.

Besides, in a Remote-First organization like Splash, an async process to present information, receive feedback and achieve alignment should be the way to go. But leave time for a brief live meeting to discuss open questions if necessary.

Let me know if you try it!

One last advice: these docs can easily get confused between proposals and requests for alignment. Be explicit with stakeholders about if this is "just an idea", or an already-made decision.
