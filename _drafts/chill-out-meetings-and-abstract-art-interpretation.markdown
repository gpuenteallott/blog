Getting a team to bond is harder in a distributed environment than in an office. In person, it was easier to run a team dynamic exercise and let relationships develop on their own later thanks to lunches, coffee breaks and happy hours.

One of the teams I manage at Splash has 5 members, which are located in Barcelona, Madrid, Philadelphia and New York City. Wow! How would we go about making a new team like this start getting along, have a laugh and trust each other?

As managers, now more than ever, we need to be intentional about investing time in fostering healthy dynamics, trust and bonding within our teams. That's the reason why I schedule a monthly Chill Out Meeting with each team I manage.

# Types of Chill Out Meetings

* **Open discussion**. Let the team talk about any topic that comes up. It's good when there are things happening in the world or the country (ehm, hello 2020?). Through this type of meeting, I've witnessed people identifying common hobbies, sharing worries, emphasizing and supporting each other.

* **Guided conversation**. Facilitate the meeting to encourage sharing and homogeneous participation. One typical question I ask is "What did you want to be when you grew up?". Depending on time available, you can pick simpler questions like "Which was a great holiday for you?" to deeper ones like "When you were growing up, who were you closer to?"

* **Play a game!** There are plenty of quick games out there to be creative, funny and a bit competitive. It doesn't matter that everybody has played [Skribbl](https://skribbl.io/) at this point, it's still a safe bet for a good time. Or even [play board games](https://en.boardgamearena.com/) if your team members are into them.

# An Experiment: Abstract Art Interpretation

Last time, I decided to spice things up with an unexpected type of Chill Out Meeting. The idea was inspired by [Teresa Gorance](https://teresagorance.wixsite.com/teresagorance/a-b-o-u-t), an artist from Madrid who creates abstract art compositions.

To play, I picked 3 pieces of artwork and played one round for each:

1. **Simple guessing**. Show the team one of the pieces of art, give them half a minute to think what they see in the image, and at the count of 3, everybody shares in the chat what they're seeing. Celebrate if some folks saw the same thing!

2. **Guess like the Product Manager**. For a team to succeed, they need to understand how the PM thinks. So for the second picture, the game is to try to guess what the PM is seeing. If your team doesn't have a PM, you may choose any other person in the team. Congrats if anybody sees the same thing as the PM!

3. **Collective Story**. For the third and final picture, after the team looks at it, have one person start telling a story using the concept that they saw in the picture. Then, that person picks the next one to go and continue the story, adding the thing they saw in the abstract art. The last person will close the story. This will just get funny and weird!

The outcome of this experiment was a super fun 30 minute Chill Out Meeting with laughter, weirdness and a feeling of relax and bonding.

Here are the 3 pieces of art by Teresa Gorance:

From that last picture, our collective story was quite intense. It was about a person swimming in the ocean, seeing a whale, then getting bitten by a shark, seeing Mufasa in the stars, being attacked by Mufasa, then being pursued by a giant space worm and finally dying. An unfortunate sad end for a hilarious story ¯\\*(ツ)*/¯ Can you see Mufasa or the space worm on the picture above?
