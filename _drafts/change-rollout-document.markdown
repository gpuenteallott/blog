In the day-to-day of the organization, you know what we don't want of?

That's right. No **surprise changes**, please. Not organizational. Not with responsibilities. Not with priorities. Not with processes.

Surprise changes lead to uncertainty. Uncertainty leads to anxiety. Anxiety leads to fear. And fear... to the dark side of the force, obviously.

But **change is necessary, both planned and unexpected**. 

How can we have the stability and safety to produce great work in an ever-changing environment? How can we roll out both planned and unexpected changes in the least surprising way possible? How can we avoid triggering fear and anxiety? 

How can we avoid needing to spend time fixing morale problems and containing the damage caused by a poorly handled change process?

Here comes my favorite artifact of 2021, the **Change Rollout Document**. To use it:

1. Duplicate the [change rollout document template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yq-gFbKIXfE7JQuDUlO0SSHS7dGqabq0aPTVOojDROU/edit?usp=sharing).

2. Fill it out.

3. Follow the timeline you wrote, adjusting as necessary along the way based on the feedback received.

This way, people have time to digest the impact of the change on their own time. To think through their concerns. To have all the information in front of them. And to asynchronously communicate their feedback.

Additionally, writing change rollout documents is a fantastic way to collaborate as leaders. At Splash, [Charlie Irwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charleslrirwin/) and I are producing 2-4 small changes per month to enable teams to produce better quality outcomes and reduce friction points. We build the documents together (asynchronously), and each of us perform different steps of the timeline.

Both Charlie and I have learned from experience that the time we don't invest upfront in writing the change rollout document, comes back later multiplied on efforts to align individuals, fix broken trust, and do damage control.

Quick unplanned changes can be necessary. The circumstances may require that. But urgency doesn't justify lack of preparation. Same as we don't make code changes in our production environment without peer review or continuous integration tests, we shouldn't apply changes without change rollout documents.
