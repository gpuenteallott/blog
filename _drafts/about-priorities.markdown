It's hard to decide what's important for your life or business. On one hand, there's so much opportunity that it's hard to choose what to focus on. On another hand, it's easy to do things that don't align with the most important things.

Recently, I went through an exercise with Abbe Cohen, product manager at Splash, to categorize the different features of Splash according to their importance to the business.

We categorized everything in three buckets:

* **Core**. They are the most important things. Without them, our company would disappear. For example: allow guests to RSVP and buy tickets; and allow event hosts to manage their guest list.
* **Adds value**. These are the things that help us grow. Without them, our expansion is limited. For example: allow guests to update their registration information; and allow hosts to customize the guest-facing messaging entirely.
* **Innovation**. These are areas to explore that could deliver value in the future. For example: allow guests to use an app to connect between each other during an event; and integrate with 3rd party event logistics services.
