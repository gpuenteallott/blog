Training my mind through meditation has enabled me to find calm more easily, slow down my pace, dissolve stress and boost my confidence on achieving my resolutions. It's been one of the biggest life improvements I've recently had. But not every meditation style resonates with me. Breathing or focusing on the senses isn't as fulfilling and successful for me. It was when I read [Passage Meditation by Eknath Easwaran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passage_Meditation) that I found the right method for me. It may be the right method for you as well.

# The Passage

Meditation consists on training the mind to focus. In order to help, we use an anchor, something to help us hold the attention. On the passage meditation, we use an inspirational passage as our anchor. It could be any passage, as long as its uplifting and helps us connect with the best version of ourselves. Spiritual passages are great for this purpose. The process will consist on slowly and silently repeating our chosen memorized passage in our minds.

The passage I normally use is the Prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi. It goes like this:

> Lord, make me an instrument of your peace,\
> Where there is hatred, let me show love;\
> Where there is injury, let me show pardon;\
> Where there is doubt, let me show faith;\
> Where there is despair, let me show hope;\
> Where there is darkness, let me show light;\
> Where there is sadness, let me show joy.

> O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek\
> To be consoled as to console,\
> To be understood as to understand,\
> To be loved as to love;\
> For it is in giving that we receive;\
> It is in pardoning that we are pardoned;\
> It is in dying to self that we are born to eternal life.

Note that Lord here can mean different things for different individuals. For me, it doesn't represent anything specific, as I see it as both the universe as a whole and the true spirit inside me.

# How?

Starting the day with meditation will be like a gift to yourself, letting the mind awake while being nourished and focused. I set an alarm with a smooth sound to let me know that 15 minutes have passed, marking the end of my meditation.

The passage meditation is effective if the mind focuses on every word, one by one, and does it very slowly. You have no rush. The slower, the harder it will be to stay focused, but also the benefit will be bigger.

The posture should be comfortable, sitting erect. I prefer to sit on a chair as it's less demanding for the body than being cross-legged on the floor.

The untrained mind doesn't like to be quiet, so it will try to find distractions to play with. They will come as thoughts on the past and the future and other preoccupations. They will come also as body sensations, like itches. Having distractions is normal. They way to deal with them is to remember your intention at this moment: meditation. You can think those things later, so just pass them and go back to focusing on the slow words in your mind. With small itches and other bothering sensations, doubling your focus on the passage will also make them fade away.

It helps to have a designated place to do it. It might be a specific area of your house or room that you dedicate to meditation. Adding a candle or a blanket there might help make it feel reserved and peaceful.

To enjoy the benefit of meditation, it needs to be a habit. Creating this healthy habit will only require committing to a routine, like spending those 15 first minutes of the day meditating.
