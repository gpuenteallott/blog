title: A structured approach to the Manager Review in Performance Reviews

Every year, managers write performance reviews. They consist of 360 feedback and goals for the next quarters, written in a document by the manager and discussed in a meeting with the direct report.

Writing good performance reviews is tough. At least for me. It isn’t fun work. At the same time, delivering a useful performance review is so fulfilling. One that makes the direct report feel understood, challenged and motivated. So despite working long hours during those weeks, I’m always looking forward to performance review periods.

Prior to the manager review, there are two sections on the performance review. You can read my reflections about them here:

* [A structured approach to the Self Review summary in Performance Reviews](https://guillermodelapuente.com/blog/structured-approach-self-review-in-performance-reviews/)

* [A structured approach to the Peer Review summary in Performance Reviews](https://guillermodelapuente.com/blog/structured-approach-peer-review-summary-in-performance-reviews/)

The final section of a performance review is the manager review. It's written by the manager and includes the additional insights and review that the manager can offer.

## The manager reviews or not?

Some companies choose to reduce the importance of the manager, or leave it out completely. That scales well for large amounts of direct reports, as it enables managers without the skill or time to write constructive reviews to still deliver a "good enough" review only though peer feedback. It also prevents biased managers from delivering a biased review.

But I'm an advocate for managers spending effort in writing useful constructive manager review sections. It's a big effort though. Requires a significant amount of data collected through the previous months, self-awareness and dedication.

## Old approach

In previous years, I wrote a long document with different paragraphs for each area of feedback. It was prose writing. Almost like a narrative.

I'm a fan of well written narratives. But when I received a structured review with different sections and organized with bullet points, I realized the narrative format was just not the appropriate one for writing an entire manager review. Thanks to my manager for showing me that.

## New approach

Following the example of Eamon's performance review he did for me in 2020, the manager performance review gets broken down into the following sections:

* What you did well

* What I want to see more

* What you struggled with

* What I don't want to see more of

* How we will work on these things over the course of the year
