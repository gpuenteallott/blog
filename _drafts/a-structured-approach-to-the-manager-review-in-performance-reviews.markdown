title: A structured approach to the Manager Review in Performance Reviews

Every year, managers write performance reviews. They consist of 360 feedback and goals for the next quarters, written in a document by the manager and discussed in a meeting with the direct report.

Writing good performance reviews is tough. At least for me. It isn’t fun work. At the same time, delivering a useful performance review is so fulfilling. One that makes the direct report feel understood, challenged and motivated. So despite working long hours during those weeks, I’m always looking forward to performance review periods.

Prior to the manager review, there are two sections on the performance review. You can read my reflections about them here:

The final section of a performance review is the manager review. It's written by the manager and includes the additional insights and review that the manager can offer.

## Old approach

In previous years, I wrote long documents, almost like narratives. They had one paragraph for each area of feedback.

I'm a fan of well written narratives. But when I received a structured review with different sections and organized with bullet points, I realized the narrative format wasn't appropriate for writing an entire manager review.

## New approach

The manager performance review is broken down into the following sections:

* What you did well

* What I want to see more

* What you struggled with

* What I don't want to see more of

* How we will work on these things over the course of the year

Note that these titles are copied literally on the review. Here's a fictional example for a manager position:

> What you did well:
>
> * Adapted quickly to lots of changes and adjustments.
>
> * Handled yourself before you got burned out.
>
> * Supported me on the hiring processes two software engineers
>
> * Represented your team VERY WELL to the rest of the organization.
>
> What I want to see more:
>
> * Throughput of your team. I need you to start thinking more on process bottlenecks and team dynamics at play in order to produce value at a more consistent quick rate.
>
> * More involvement on hiring processes as an autonomous hiring manager.
>
> What you struggled with:
>
> * Communication at high levels. Your communication with the individual contributors is good, but you've had situations of misunderstadings or lack of alignment with other managers.
>
> * Reducing shadow work. We've discussed previously, but I see you still do a significant amount of work that goes under the radar and isn't documented anywhere.
>
> ...

I want to credit [Eamon Bisson-Donahue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eamon-bisson-donahue/) for this. He prepared my review using a similar format in 2020 and that inspired me to iterate.

## Feedback time? \[TODO\]

When I started at Splash, we used to do "\[P\]reviews". They essentially were performance reviews, but focused on next steps, on a "preview" of the future. At the beginning I loved this concept. It felt less corporate and more considerate for people.

With time, I've changed my mind. A performance review is and should be a review of past performance. That's it. And they should be taken seriously. Respecting your team is preparing solid performance reviews that include data, repeat feedback that's been shared previously and summarize peer and direct reports feedback in a way that encourages behavior improvement.

A performance review can finish looking at the future. With a discussion of next steps, goals, or proposed tactics. That's great.  That should be the outcome of a performance review, to think critically on the information received and collaborate with your manager on figuring out next steps. But, to me, this isn't strictly part of the performance review process, as this conversation should continue during most 1:1s.

## Does the manager review or not?

Some companies choose to reduce the importance of the manager in the performance review, or leave it out completely. That scales well for large amounts of direct reports, as it enables managers without the skill or time to write constructive reviews to still deliver a "good enough" review only though peer feedback. It also prevents biased managers from delivering a biased review.

But I'm an advocate for managers spending effort in writing useful constructive manager review sections. It's a big effort though. Requires a significant amount of data collected through the previous months, self-awareness and dedication.
