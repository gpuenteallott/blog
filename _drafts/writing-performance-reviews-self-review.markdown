Every year, managers write performance reviews. A review should basically consist on summarizing 360 feedback and defining goals for the next quarters.

## My journey preparing performance reviews

Writing a good performance review is tough. At least for me. It isn't "fun work". At the same time, delivering a useful performance review is so fulfilling to me. One that makes the direct report feel understood, challenged and motivated. So despite me working long hours during those weeks, I'm always looking forward to performance review periods.

In the past, I've spent many hours preparing each performance review. Analyzing each piece of feedback, data and notes. Back then, I formatted them as letters. Lots of paragraphs and not many bullet points. While my motivations were good, the process didn't scale for me, nor this format was helpful for direct reports.

This year, I've followed a more structured approach. That has helped me save time and create more consistency across my directs reports.

## The importance of the self review summary

The first section of a performance review document is the self review. It's a summary of what the candidate wrote in their self review form. It's important not to change its meaning or disagree with it. As managers, we want to understand the direct and make them feel understood.

## My new approach

When preparing the self review section of the written performance review, my new scalable approach is to summarize or reword what the direct report wrote, question by question. Example:

> *\[What were your accomplishments?\]
> You wrote two. The first was establishing good incident response practices. The second...*

Copying the question name can feel too scripted. Not everybody enjoys that. It's easy to make it more conversational:

> *You wrote about two main accomplishments during the last period. The first was establishing good incident response practices. The second...*

## Questions matter

The usefulness of the summary depends on the questions asked on the self review form. So far, these are the ones I've found most helpful:

* What were your accomplishments?

* What things you didn't accomplish?

* What do you like the most about your current role?

* What things will you focus on to help you grow and develop?

* How can your manager support you on those things?

There's a temptation to ask also about other things that relate to the organization more than to the individual, like "what things of the company would you change?" or "what additional support can the organization give you to achieve those goals?". These questions are very valuable, but don't belong in a performance review process. Let's not mix company surveys with performance reviews.

I'll cover other sections in future blog posts.
