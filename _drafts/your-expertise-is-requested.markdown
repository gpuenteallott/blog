LinkedIn showed an excellent example of applying persuasion techniques on the last email I received from them, in September 2018.

**Subject:** Your Expertise is Requested

**Body:**

Would you fill out the survey? Let's analyze it.

**Liking**

First, we have the subject "*Your Expertise is Requested*". Second, the email body starts with "*Hello Valued Member*". Third, it continues with "*You've been selected*" to clearly indicate that the user is special and has been picked among the rest. These are compliments and are attempting to make the reader feel important.

People prefer to say yes to those that they like. The goal of those lines is to make the reader like LinkedIn more, preparing the ground for a request.

**Reciprocity**

Observe the seemingly innocent note:

"*We thank you in advance for your participation!*"

Thanking in advance is an effective way to lock in the reader to take an action. Otherwise, having already received gratitude, the reader might feel guilty if not performing the action.

The reciprocity principle affects us by making us feel obliged to return back a favor.

**Scarcity**

To me, it's the most astonishing persuasion technique. Carefully read the following sentence:

"*To take part, please respond in the next few days as we will close the survey once we receive the desired number of qualified responses.*"

The ability to take action is limited both in time and quantity. Unless the user fills out the survey soon, they might loose the opportunity to do it.

It's human nature that when something is limited, we want it even more. Moreover, we frequently want things only when they are scarce, not being interested if there was abundance.

Here's the catch: a LinkedIn user obtains no real benefit or reward from of filling out the survey. Why would they spend their time doing it?

Some LinkedIn users might be inclined to cooperate based on previous reasons. However, the messaging was carefully designed to target that majority of users that normally would not be interested. With a bit of influence and persuasion, they might just comply with the request.

How could we make this email even more persuasive? Here are some thoughts:

* Indicating why filling out the survey is important. A simple "...so that we can keep making LinkedIn better" would suffice.
* Adding social proof. Could be something like "Members that benefit from LinkedIn, like you, continuously help us improve". Note that this sentence also plays with the principle of consistency, another influence technique.
