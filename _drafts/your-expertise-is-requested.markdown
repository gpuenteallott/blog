LinkedIn showed an excellent example of applying persuasion techniques on the last email I received from them, in September 2018.

**Subject:** Your Expertise is Requested

**Body:**

Would you fill out the survey? Let's analyze it.

**Liking**

First, we have the subject "*Your Expertise is Requested*". It obviously implies that the reader has expertise. Second, the email body starts with "*Hello Valued Member*". Both are forms of compliment and are attempting to make the reader feel important.

We continue with "You've been selected". Apparently, the reader not only is valued, but also has been picked among the rest.

People prefer to say yes to those that they like. It's not a coincidence that all the complementing leads to the user liking LinkedIn more.

**Reciprocity**

Observe the seemingly innocent note:

"*We thank you in advance for your participation!*"

Thanking in advance is an effective way to lock in the reader to take action. Otherwise, the reader, having already received gratitude, might feel guilty for not performing the action that would result in that gratitude.

The reciprocity principle affects us by making us feel obliged to return back a favor.

**Scarcity**

It's the most astonishing persuasion technique. Carefully read the following sentence:

"*To take part, please respond in the next few days as we will close the survey once we receive the desired number of qualified responses.*"

The ability to take action is limited both in time and quantity. Unless the user fills out the survey soon, they might loose the opportunity to do it.

It's human nature that when something is limited, we want it even more. Moreover, we end up wanting things only when they are scarce, not being interested if there were plenty.

Here's the catch: a LinkedIn user gets no real benefit or reward out of filling out the survey. Why would they spend their time doing it?

Some LinkedIn users might be inclined to cooperate based on their own previous reasons. However, the email was carefully designed for that majority of users that normally would not be interested. With a bit of influence and persuasion, they might just become interested.

How could we make this email even more persuasive?

* Indicating why filling out the survey is important. A simple "...so that we can keep making LinkedIn more useful to our users" would suffice.
* Adding social proof. Could be something like "Members that benefit from LinkedIn, like you, continuously help us improve". Note that this sentence also plays with the principle of consistency, another influence technique.
