Every year, managers write performance reviews. They should consist of 360 feedback and goals for the next quarters, written in a document by the manager and discussed in a meeting with the direct report.

## My journey preparing performance reviews

Writing good performance reviews is tough. At least for me. It isn't fun work. At the same time, delivering a useful performance review is so fulfilling. One that makes the direct report feel understood, challenged and motivated. So despite working long hours during those weeks, I'm always looking forward to performance review periods.

In the past, I've spent many hours preparing each performance review. Analyzing each piece of feedback, data and notes. Back then, I formatted them as letters. Lots of paragraphs and not many bullet points. The process didn't scale for me, nor that format was helpful for direct reports.

This year, I've followed a more structured approach. That has helped me save time and create more consistency across reviews.

## The importance of the self review summary

The first section of a performance review document is the self review. It's a summary of what the candidate wrote in their self review form. It's important not to change its meaning or disagree with it. We want to understand the direct and make them feel understood.

## My new approach

When preparing the self review section of the written performance review, my new scalable approach is to summarize or reword what the direct report wrote, question by question. Example:

> *\[What were your accomplishments?\]
> You wrote two. The first was establishing good incident response practices. The second...*

If copying the question name feels too scripted, it's easy to make it more conversational:

> *You wrote about two main accomplishments during the last period. The first was establishing good incident response practices. The second...*

## Questions matter

The usefulness of the self review depends on the questions asked on the evaluation form. So far, these are the ones I've found most helpful:

* What were your accomplishments?

* What things didn't you accomplish?

* What do you like the most about your current role?

* What things will you focus on to help you grow and develop?

* How can your manager support you on those things?

There's a temptation to ask also about other things that relate to the organization more than to the individual. For example, "what would you change about the company?", or "what additional support can the organization give you to achieve those goals?". These questions are very valuable, but don't belong in a performance review process. Let's not mix company surveys with performance reviews.
