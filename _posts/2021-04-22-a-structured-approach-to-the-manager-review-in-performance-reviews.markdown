title: A structured approach to the Manager Review in Performance Reviews

Every year, managers write performance reviews. They consist of 360 feedback and goals for the next quarters, written in a document by the manager and discussed in a meeting with the direct report.

Writing good performance reviews is tough. At least for me. It isn’t fun work. At the same time, delivering a useful performance review is so fulfilling. One that makes the direct report feel understood, challenged and motivated. So despite working long hours during those weeks, I’m always looking forward to performance review periods.

Prior to the manager review, there are two sections on the performance review. You can read my reflections about them here:

The final section of a performance review is the manager review. It's written by the manager and includes the additional insights and feedback that the manager can offer.

## Old approach

In previous years, I wrote long documents, almost like narratives. They had one paragraph for each area of feedback.

I'm a fan of well written narratives. But when I received a structured review with different sections and organized with bullet points, I realized the narrative format wasn't appropriate for writing an entire manager review.

## New approach

Following the example of  [Eamon Bisson-Donahue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eamon-bisson-donahue/), now I break it down into the following parts:

* What you did well

* What I want to see more

* What you struggled with

* What I don't want to see more of

* How we will work on these things over the course of the year

Here's a fictional example for a manager position:

> What you did well:
>
> * Adapted quickly to lots of changes and adjustments.
>
> * Handled yourself before you got burned out.
>
> * Supported me on the hiring processes two software engineers
>
> * Represented your team VERY WELL to the rest of the organization.
>
> What I want to see more:
>
> * Throughput of your team. I need you to start thinking more on process bottlenecks and team dynamics at play in order to produce value at a more consistent quick rate.
>
> * More involvement on hiring processes as an autonomous hiring manager.
>
> What you struggled with:
>
> * Communication at high levels. Your communication with the individual contributors is good, but you've had situations of misunderstadings or lack of alignment with other managers.
>
> * Reducing shadow work. We've discussed previously, but I see you still do a significant amount of work that goes under the radar and isn't documented anywhere.

## What's the goal of a review?

When I started at Splash, we used to do "\[P\]reviews". They essentially were performance reviews, but focused on next steps, on a "preview" of the future. At the beginning I loved this concept. It felt less corporate.

Over time, I've changed my mind. Performance reviews should be taken seriously and be a detailed review of past performance, coming from peers, managers, direct reports and data. That's it.

However, apart from making every person aware of their performance as seen from multiple angles, the goal of the performance review is to influence future behavior. Same as feedback. A performance review is successful if it makes the candidate self-aware, motivated, challenged, and wanting to be better at their job or continue growing.

Discussing all those next steps isn't strictly part of the performance review meeting, but part of each following 1:1.

## Does the manager review or not?

Some companies choose to reduce the importance of the manager in the performance review, or leave it out completely. That scales well for large amounts of direct reports. It enables managers without the skill or time to write constructive reviews to still deliver a "good enough" review based on peer feedback. It also prevents biased managers from delivering a biased review.

But I'm an advocate for managers spending effort in writing thought-out constructive manager review sections. Those are the ones that make the biggest differences.

However, managers need support, tools and processes to produce these reviews matching a quality standard and consistently enough across the organization. How to do that? I'm still figuring out.
