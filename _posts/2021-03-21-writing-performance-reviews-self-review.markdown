Managers write performance reviews every year, or every 6 months. A review should basically be a 360 feedback report, combined with additional suggestions, feedback and goals for the next period.

Writing a good performance review is tough. At least for me. It isn't "fun work". But it's one of the most satisfactory activities I do at work. I'm always looking forward to performance review periods.

In the past, I've spent many hours preparing each performance reviews, analyzing each piece of feedback and reviewing historical data and notes. I then formatted it as a letter, so lots of paragraphs and not too many bullet points. While the motivation was good, the process didn't scale for me, nor this format was helpful for direct reports.

This year, I've followed a more structured approach. That has helped me save time and create more consistency across my directs.

# Self review

The first section of a performance review document is the self review. It's a summary of what the candidate wrote in their self review form. It's important not to change its meaning or challenge it, because want to 1) understand the direct, and 2) make them feel understood.

The quality of the self review summary depends on the quality of the questions asked when filling out the form. These are the ones I've found most helpful so far:

* What were your accomplishments?
* What things you didn't accomplish?
* What do you like the most about your current role?
* What things will you focus on to help you grow and develop?
* How can your manager support you on those things?

When writing the summary, my approach is to go question by question summarizing or re-wording what the direct report wrote. Example:

> What were your accomplishments?
> You wrote two. The first was establishing good incident response practices in the department. The second...

Going question by question can also feel too scripted. That's easy to change:

> You wrote about two main accomplishments during the last period. The first was establishing good incident response practices in the department. The second...

There's a temptation to ask also about other things that relate to the organization more than to the individual, like "what things of the company would you change?" or "what additional support can the organization give you to achieve those goals?". To me, these questions are very valuable, but don't belong inside a performance review process.

I'll cover other sections in future blog posts
