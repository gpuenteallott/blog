Getting a team to bond is harder in a distributed environment than in an office. In person, I used to run team building exercises and then let relationships develop on their own thanks to lunches, coffee breaks and happy hours. But working remotely, we don't have those casual gatherings.

One of the teams I manage at [Splash](https://splashthat.com/) has 5 members located in Barcelona, Madrid, Philadelphia and New York City. Wow! How would we go about making such a team start getting along, understanding and trusting each other?

Here come **Team Meetups**, one of my recipes for creating a space to connect as a team. I schedule them once a month or every other month.

## Types of Team Meetups

* **Open discussion**, letting the team talk about any topics that come up organically. I find it good when there are things causing stress, happening in the world or the company (ehm, hello 2020?). Through this type of meeting, I've witnessed people identifying common hobbies, sharing worries, empathizing and supporting each other.

* **Guided conversation** to encourage sharing and equal participation. One typical question I ask is "What did you want to be when you grew up?". Depending on the amount of trust within the team, I sometimes pick simpler questions, like "What is the best trip you've even taken?", or emotionally deeper ones, like "When you were growing up, who were you closer to?"

* **Play a game!** There are plenty of quick games to be creative, funny and a bit competitive. It doesn't matter that everybody has played [Skribbl](https://skribbl.io/) at this point, it's still a safe bet for a good time. We also [play board games](https://en.boardgamearena.com/) if the team members are into them.

## An Experiment: Abstract Art Interpretation

Last time, I decided to spice it up with a surprise type of Team Meetup. The idea was inspired by [Teresa Gorance](https://teresagorance.wixsite.com/teresagorance/a-b-o-u-t), an artist from Madrid who creates abstract art compositions like these:

![Screen Shot 2020-11-08 at 20.52.46.png](/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202020-11-08%20at%2020.52.46.png)

The compositions are completely abstract, but our brains are wired to find shapes and meaning. It's like when look up at the clouds in the sky.

To play, I picked 3 pieces of artwork, and we played one game for each:

1. **Simple interpretation**. I showed the team a piece of art and gave them half a minute to observe it. At the count of 3, everybody shared in the chat what they're seeing. When some of us wrote the same thing, we celebrated it.\

   What do you see here?\

   Some of our answers were a rooster, an upside down baby, a dancer and a tooth.

2. **Think like the Product Manager**. For a team to succeed, they need to understand how the PM thinks. So for the second picture, the game was to try guessing what the PM was seeing. Some people got it right!\

   What do you see here?\

3. **Collective story**. For the third and final picture, after the team looked at it for a minute, one person started telling a story using what they saw. Then, the next person continued it including what they saw too. The last one closed the story.\
   \
   Our collective story quickly got very intense. It started with a person swimming in the ocean, seeing a whale, then getting bitten by a shark, seeing Mufasa in the stars, being attacked by Mufasa, then being pursued by a giant space worm and finally dying. Sad end, but oh well.\

   \
   Can you see Mufasa or the space worm in the picture below?\

The outcome of this experiment was a super fun 30-minute Team Meetup with laughter, weirdness and a feeling of relax and bonding.

If you'd like to follow this format with your team, go for it!

## Conclusion

I use Team Meetups to unite teams, spending quality time through conversations or playing games. This is part of the journey to achieving high performance as a team.
